# Course Name - Learning how to Learn; Coursera

* 2 modes of thinking: Focussed and Diffused
* Analogies provide a powerful method for learning
* When learning something new - Alternate your brain between 2 modes: focussed and diffused
  * In diffused mode, try and relax in an activity that helps you to reduce focus on the problem at hand, while having a lingering thought on it. This helps in getting some alternative thoughts in your mind, that otherwise might not come in a focussed mode. It also gives you a fresh approach while trying to go back to focussed mode.
* While learning something new, always keep giving efforts in small installments, but never give up. With time, any new topic is achievable.
