* 2 modes of thinking: Focussed and Diffused
* Analogies provide a powerful method for learning
* When learning something new - Alternate your brain between 2 modes: focussed and diffused
  * In diffused mode, try and relax in an activity that helps you to reduce focus on the problem at hand, while having a lingering thought on it. This helps in getting some alternative thoughts in your mind, that otherwise might not come in a focussed mode. It also gives you a fresh approach while trying to go back to focussed mode.
* While learning something new, always keep giving efforts in small installments, but never give up. With time, any new topic is achievable.
* Pro-castinatation:
  * Why: Brain stimulates pain-centers when we face an uncomfortable problem. Hence, it tries to distract by moving to more comfortable and pleasant situations.
  * Solution: Keep a timer of 25 minutes and force yourself to do an activity. Reward yourself with a happy activity after this. Then, repeat.
  * Take that small break is as important as forcing yourself to sit for this activity.
  * Gradually, the more time you spend, the more expert you become on the unfamiliar topic.
 * Practice is critical.
   * When faced with a tough challenge, redundancy is key.
   * You can start off a challenge by following an initial approach, could be overview or done casually.
   * Repeat the same activity and this time it will be more focussed.
   * By the 3rd iteration, you would already have grasped the very internals of the task.
   * Your brain now is more focussed and can provide much better inputs.
 * Spaced Repetition.
   * Repeating activities after a period of time, like next day, after 2 days, etc. makes it much more effective.
   * Repeating the same exercise in a day might not be as effective and long-lasting as repeating the activity the next day.
 * Sleep - an unknown best-friend
   * Sleep after a focussed activity helps to enhance the diffused learning and rejuvenates you when you re-attempt the task.
   * Sleep washes away harmful toxins in the brain to help it work better.
   * Sleep de-clutters your mind to focus better.
   * Always pre-fix your sleep with a focussed and tedious session on the activity for best results.
